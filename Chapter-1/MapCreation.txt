Task-1 : Map Creation: Think of a real-world system, like a library or a shopping mall. How would 
you model it using OOP concepts? What are the objects, their attributes, and behaviors? How do they
interact?

Encapsulation 
	As the library manager, you use encapsulation to hide the specific details of each book 
(like ISBN and author) and provide controlled access for visitors to borrow and return books, 
ensuring data privacy and security.
Objects:
	1 . Book 
			Attributes :
				1. Title
				2. author
				3. ISBN
			Behaviour :
				1 . Borrow Book
				2 . Return Book

	2 . library
			Attributes :
				1 . books
				2 . Members
			Behaviour :
				1 . Add Book
				2 . Remove Book
				3 . Search Book

	3 . Members
			Attributes :
				1 . Name
				2 . MemberID/Roll Number
			Behaviour :

Inheritance
	we can establish a common superclass for books to handle shared attributes and behaviors among 
all book types. This allows for more specialized book types to inherit these common properties and 
add their own unique attributes and methods. 
Super Class :
	Attributes :
		Title
		author
		ISBN
	Behaviour :
		Borrow Book
		Return book
Sub Class :
	Attributes :
		
	Behaviour :
		

Polymorphism
	Polymorphism allows us to interact with different types of library items (e.g., books and DVDs) 
through a common interface, simplifying the management of diverse items within the library system.
Objects : 
	1 . Library Item (Common Interface):
			Attributes :
				1 . Title
				2 . Item
			Behaviour :
				1 . Get Information(provide item details)
				2 . Check Out(used for borrowing)
				3 . Return(used for returning)
	2 . Book (Implements LibraryItem Interface)
			Attributes : 
				1 . author
				2 . ISBN
			Behaviour : 
				Implement Library Item methods for Check Out, Return, and Get Information.	

Abstraction
	In the library, you will find all sorts of books, but you don't need to worry about how they were 
made or who brought them. The library is a place to read and learn, not a store where you buy books.
Objects : 
	1 . Library Book
		Attributes :
			1. Title
			2. author
		Behaviour :
			1. Borrow
			2. Return
	2 . Library Member
		Attributes :
			1 . Name
			2 . Member
		Behaviour :
			1. Borrow Book
			2. Return Book
