5. Reflect on Dependencies: Think about all the services and tools youâ€™d rely on during your Swiss 
journey, from travel agencies to GPS apps. How do these dependencies relate to the Dependency
Inversion Principle in software design?

    Imagine you want to go on a trip to Switzerland. You pack your bags with clothes, visa, and your 
passport. But when you're going to a new country, it's not easy to plan everything by yourself. 
That's where travel agencies come in. They help you with all the detailed planning. In this analogy, 
Switzerland is like the main idea (high-level), and the travel agency is the practical help you need 
(low-level) to make your trip happen.
